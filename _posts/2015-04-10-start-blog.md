Recently I saw use and importance Git and came across GitHub, then found this wonderful thing called GitHub Page.

I have used WordPress and Umbraco before, they are CMS based and good for heavy weight websites - Faster development & Good built in SEO.

For light weight comes GitHub Page!

With GitHub you can make websites for you and your projects.

It's so easy that you can host directly from your GitHub repository - Just edit, push, and your changes are instant.

The general practice is you get one site per GitHub account and organization, with unlimited project sites.

You can clone someone's repository or write your own code for page!
